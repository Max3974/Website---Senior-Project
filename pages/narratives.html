        <h2>Create Narrative</h2>

        <p><p><strong>Your TASK-based narrative:</strong> if you are the PI on one of the defined tasks charged to the 2016-2020 JHC grant, it is your responsibility to coordinate with contributors to the task and write a single, report-ready narrative for that research area. Look at a previous progress report to see the general style (<a href="http://ccom.unh.edu/reports">http://ccom.unh.edu/reports</a>).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>You must submit a narrative document for each task for which you are the PI, even if there is no progress to report. If this is the case, please provide some indication, to the extent that you know, of when you expect there to be some progress.</li>
            <li>Please let the people working on tasks for which you are the PI know when you want them to provide their contributions for your write-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Please make sure that each narrative is associated with only one JHC task</strong>. If what you're talking about is relevant to more than one task (e.g., if it has some component that's better reported in a second task), either split your report, or cross-reference the material â€” don't just write one report titled, "Task X and Task Y." If you can't work out a good split, please let either Larry or Brian know.</li>
            <li>You're submitting what should be "report ready" text. That is, the final text to be submitted to NOAA for our progress report. This means that you need to pay attention to things like context, technical level, tone, and volume. Specifically:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remember that the person reading this probably hasn't been following your research closely, so they're going to need some context as to what it is that you're doing, why it's important, and what the implications are for the larger ocean mapping community if it works out well. Implications and importance are the essential parts that you have to hit, since they're what convince people that what we're doing is worth the money they're paying.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the target audience here is NOAA technical managers who may or may not have a background in your particular sub-discipline. That is, they'll probably have some technical background, possibly in hydrography, but may not have used it recently. Don't write as if you're preparing a paper for a journal, but also don't write as if it's for the general public.</li>
                    <li>Use the style guidelines in this document (see a little further down). Be careful about names, and specifically that you say "the Center" generically and not "CCOM" specifically (use JHC instead). This is the Joint Hydrographic Center grant and NOAA is sensitive to the nomenclature being correct.</li>
                    <li>There is no particular limit to the length of the report, but that isn't carte blanche to write dozens of pages. That's a waste of your time and ours in editing it down to something useful.</li>
                    <li>Use images when possible, since they often tell the story more fully and clearly than anything else. When you include an image, make sure that you hold on to the highest resolution version of it so that you can upload it with your narrative. More on this below.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Your PERSONAL narrative</strong>: Collate any of your work that's funded from sources other than the JHC grant, that you think is relevant, or could be relevant, to the JHC grant's progress, in a separate personal narrative. If all of your work fits into existing task-based narratives, you do not have to submit a personal narrative.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If you are not a PI but are contributing to a task-based narrative, summarize that work in a separate document per the instructions of your PI. Send the document to the PI associated with the task so they can collate all of the individual components into a single document report that they will submit. To make things simpler for the PIs, please name your document with the task number, and your family name. So, if you're reporting on Task 9, for example, your document would be "09_Smith.docx". The leading "0" helps to keep things sorted.</li>
            <li>Write in the third person. This will be extremely helpful to Larry as he won't have convert all of the "I"s to your name and change all of your pronouns.</li>
            <li>The first time you refer to yourself in a section, use your full name, e.g., "Dr. James V. Gardner." After that, use your last name only.</li>
            <li>Upload ALL of the images you use in your report.</li>
            <li>Number your figures sequentially within the narrative for each task. More on that in the formatting guide below.</li>
            <li>Do not upload images that are not in your report.</li>
            <li>Center all images and tables and center justify their captions.</li>
            <li>Collate any work that you haven't reported otherwise into a final personal narrative document, and name it with your family name, and the year. As the last section of this document, please list the tasks on which you've worked (and submitted components to the associated PI). Upload this to the progress report website as a Personal Narrative when you enter the rest of your reporting information.</li>
            <li>If you're unsure where to report something that you've done, please talk with the PI of the task that you think is most likely; they'll be able to help you out. If you're really stuck, please let either Larry or Brian know, and they'll work it out.</li>
        </ul>
